        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>
          My name is NguyÃªn, and I am a passionate Frontend Developer with a knack
          for creating visually appealing and highly functional user interfaces.
          With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I specialize in
          building responsive and dynamic web applications that offer a seamless
          user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past few years, I have honed my skills in various frontend
          frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, and Vue.js. I am also
          proficient in using modern development tools and methodologies,
          including Git, Webpack, and Agile practices, to ensure efficient and
          effective project delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my key strengths is my ability to transform complex
          requirements into intuitive and user-friendly designs. I enjoy
          collaborating with designers, backend developers, and stakeholders to
          bring ideas to life and deliver products that meet both technical
          specifications and user expectations.
        </p>

          I am constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest
          industry trends and technologies. This continuous learning process
          enables me to bring fresh ideas and innovative solutions to the
          projects I work on.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and
          participating in coding challenges to further sharpen my skills. I am
          also passionate about mentoring aspiring developers and sharing my
          knowledge with the community.
        </p>

          to connecting and exploring opportunities to create amazing digital
          experiences together!
